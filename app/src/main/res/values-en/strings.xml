    <string name="mario_name">Mario Mario</string>
    <string name="description_mario">Mario (formerly known as Jumpman, and developed under the nickname Mr. Video) is Nintendo\'s mascot and the main protagonist of the Mario franchise. Mario made his first appearance as the protagonist of the arcade game Donkey Kong, released in 1981. \n\nSince Super Mario Bros., his abilities have included his jumping and stomping powers, which he uses to defeat most of his enemies, as well as his ability to gain powers from a plethora of items, such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Super Star. \n\nThe games have generally portrayed Mario as a silent character without a distinct personality (Fortune Street is a notable exception). According to Nintendo\'s philosophy, this allows Mario to fit into many different genres and roles. \n\nIn most games, he is the hero who embarks on an adventure to save Princess Peach from his archenemy, Bowser, but he has also been shown engaging in many other activities besides adventuring, such as competing and playing sports with his younger twin brother and others.</string>
    <string name="abilities_mario">Mario\'s most notable ability is his Jump, which is his basic movement that he relies on to defeat enemies, avoid obstacles, and activate useful objects such as ? Blocks and P Switches. Although Luigi has superior jumps, Mario is more well-known. \n\nHe is also capable of performing several acrobatic maneuvers, such as the Long Jump, Backflip, Spin Jump, and Wall Jump, with the Wall Jump being one of his most recurring abilities. \n\nMario can also use a variety of basic martial arts attacks, including punches and kicks, although in most games, jumping remains his primary form of attack. \n\nMario\'s main weapon is the Hammer in Donkey Kong, although he often uses the Hammer as a weapon in Mario role-playing games (RPGs).</string>

    <string name="description_luigi">Luigi is a cheerful, optimistic, kind, noble, relaxed, ambivert, sensitive, and dreamy character with a strong sense of justice and morality, just like his brother Mario. However, Luigi is also a bit more fearful and self-conscious, often becoming nervous when he senses danger.\n\nHis biggest fear is ghosts, but despite this, he is able to overcome his fears to save his friends. This bravery is most notably seen in the Luigi\'s Mansion series, where he faces ghosts head-on, even though he is visibly terrified.\n\nLuigi also displays a somewhat childish side, as seen in Mario y Luigi: Bowser\'s Inside Story, where he throws a tantrum when he fails to catch the worm causing them trouble or when he starts tickling the head stick.\n\nDespite his playful and sometimes timid nature, Luigi is fully capable of getting serious when necessary, showing great resolve and bravery when the situation demands it.</string>

Although she occasionally appears naive, she is generally sensible and shows more common sense than those around her.
